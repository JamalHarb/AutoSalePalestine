# Auto Sale Palestine

Starting off with a brief description of our project, the idea of our project first came from the difficulties each Palestinian person faces to either look for or buy a car. Therefore, we thought of why not making it easier to whoever wants to sell or buy one. In Auto Sale Palestine website, you can be either a seller or a customer, you can sell your own car or buy yourself a one. If you were a seller and interested in selling your vehicle, by uploading an image of your vehicle with a description of it including the manufacturer, model, color, year, and many more, you can start receiving request posts from customers whom are interested in buying the car. Otherwise, if you were a customer and interested in a specific car, all you have to do is filter the car you are looking for, and the website will show you results of your filter. Afterword, if you find a car that matches what you are looking for and feel that you would like to contact the seller, then you can send a request post by clicking I’m interested link that will be available on the My Cars page and the seller will reply to you as a comment. However, on our website it’s not necessary to be registered in order to search for a car, but it is necessary to register if you want to send a request or upload your own car for sell. In this project we have worked hard enough to deliver as mush help as we could for people around our country.
